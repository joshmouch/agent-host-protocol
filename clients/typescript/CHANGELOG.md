# Changelog — `@microsoft/agent-host-protocol` (TypeScript)

All notable changes to the TypeScript client package are documented here. See
[`../../CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) for the protocol spec changelog
and [`release-metadata.json`](release-metadata.json) for the machine-readable
mapping between the current source tree and protocol versions.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the package follows [SemVer](https://semver.org).

The `publish-typescript.yml` workflow refuses to publish a `typescript/vX.Y.Z`
tag whose matching `## [X.Y.Z]` heading is missing from this file. (Note: the
publish workflow itself ships in a separate PR; until that lands, the only
enforcement is at `npm test` time.)

## [Unreleased]

Implements AHP `0.2.0`.

## [0.2.0] — Unreleased

Implements AHP `0.2.0`.

- `/client` subpath — `AhpClient`, `Subscription`, `AhpStateMirror`,
  `AhpTransport` interface, `InMemoryTransport`, error taxonomy.
- `/ws` subpath — `WebSocketTransport` built on the global `WebSocket`.
